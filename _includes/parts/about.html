            <h3>Tara Cramer</h3>
            <p>
            The youngest of three children, Tara quickly learned to hold her own with much older and larger siblings and cousins.
            She accomplished this by developing an somewhat obnoxious sarcastic sensibility.
            Tara is an advocate of women’s and animal rights and hopes to raise her children with a passion for activism.
            She has a Sarah Silverman-like sense of humor and enjoys making Simpsons and Seinfeld references in everyday conversation.
            A former psychology major, Tara gave up her dreams of becoming a tenured psychobiology professor to begin raising a family.
            With her she brings two amazing children into this family from a previous marriage; Nicholas and Samantha.

            <h3>Ryan Glover</h3>
            <p>
            A dashing young cosmopolitan from West Michigan, Ryan is no stranger to blended families with claim to no less than five quirky siblings.
            He has a propensity for imitating voices, training canines and children, brainstorming great brand names, and writing clean code.  He also has the voice of an angel.  It's like Fergie meets Jesus.
            After a brief parlay at Michigan State University, Ryan left to join the airforce and serve his country as a Chinese Mandarin linguist.
            Along the way, Ryan became a father to two amazing girls, Isabelle and Amelia who have enriched his life more than he ever thought possible.

            <h3>How We Met</h3>
            <p>
            In October 2009, Tara began a new employment venture at the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.
            Tara arrived to find her teammate Ryan, who was vastly more knowledgeable about proper code development.
            Ryan arrived to find an unexpected new ‘supervisor’ who was also sporting a black eye at the time.

            After flirting outrageously with him for a few weeks, Tara was thrilled when Ryan finally asked her out to a work function in DC on October 30th.
            They moved in together as one big happy family about a year and a half later.  In 2014, the family welcomed their newest member, Cross.

                <p>
                A long time in the making, Ryan finally asked Tara to marry him after they had already begun
                discussing wedding plans.  To say Tara was impatient would be an understatement. However, Ryan
                managed to make the moment special by taking her to breathtaking Lake Michigan and surprising her
                on a small hike through the dunes.  Cross was there to share the moment, while the other children
                were out frolicking in the frigid waters of the Lake.
